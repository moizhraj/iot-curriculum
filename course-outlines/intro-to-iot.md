# Introduction to the Internet of Things

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection of physical computing systems, using a combination of hardware and software that can sense input from the real world and broadcast/respond to it in real-time. Students will learn how to design and develop prototype IoT systems using a rapid-prototyping approach and evaluate the interactive aspects the system affords end-users. Industry standard IoT low-power microcontrollers, sensors, and protocols will be at the forefront of the student development experience.

## Suggested course outline

* Evolution of IoT
* Real world and physical device interfaces (hubs/controllers/microcontroller devices, sensors, actuators)
* Cloud Computing (IoT and Serverless Computing)
* Secure device provisioning
* REST APIs
* IoT Standards and Protocols (e.g. Infrastructure, Discovery, and Data transfer protocols)
* Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) concepts and functions
* Publish/Subscribe patterns
* IoT security (e.g. man-in-the-middle attacks)
* Scalable, lightweight storage platforms

## Learning outcomes

* Critically evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, and resource constraints of IoT computing systems in comparison to traditional computing models
* Design and implement a connected prototype IoT software system that utilizes sensor data
* Implement industry standard IoT messaging protocols

## Hardware

* [MXChip (Azure IoT Dev Kit)](https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/) - an Arduino-compatible IoT developer kit that can also run [Azure RTOS](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started/tree/master/MXChip/AZ3166), with onboard sensors, buttons, LEDs and an OLED screen. This dev kit is designed to work with Microsoft Azure.
