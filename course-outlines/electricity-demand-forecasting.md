# Electricity demand forecasting

Electricity demand forecasting is an important area of study for energy management and maintenance scheduling. To address these business needs, companies are looking into appropriate technologies and machine learning-based solutions to forecast electricity demand. In the past few decades, machine learning model-based forecasting has also become very popular in the private and the public decision-making process.
In this course, students will learn the most important concepts and tools for building, training, and deploying demand forecasting models. Students will build a theoretical foundation as we cover the essential aspects of time series representations, modeling, and forecasting before diving into deep learning methods for forecasting time series data.

Students will then gain hands-on experience applying these models to a real-world scenario, using Azure and machine learning components available in open source Python packages, such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) and [Keras](https://keras.io).
