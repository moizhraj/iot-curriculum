# Azure Kinect DK

Azure Kinect DK is a developer kit with advanced AI sensors that provide sophisticated computer vision and speech models. Kinect contains a depth sensor, spatial microphone array with a video camera, and orientation sensor as an all in-one small device with multiple modes, options, and software development kits (SDKs).

The Azure Kinect DK is not a standalone device - it needs to be connected to a PC running either Windows or Linux. This PC will also need an NVIDIA GPU if you want to use the Body Tracking SDK. You can read more in the [system requirements documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/kinect-dk/system-requirements?WT.mc_id=academic-7372-jabenn).
