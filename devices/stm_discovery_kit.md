# STM Discovery Kit

The [B-L475E-IOT01A Discovery kit for IoT node](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l475e-iot01a.html) allows users to develop applications with direct connection to cloud servers.

The Discovery kit enables a wide diversity of applications by exploiting low-power communication, multiway sensing and Arm® Cortex® -M4 core-based STM32L4 Series features.
The support for Arduino Uno V3 and PMOD connectivity provides unlimited expansion capabilities with a large choice of specialized add-on boards.
