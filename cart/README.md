# IoT Cart

When deciding on what IoT projects to embark on for a course, usually the first question is what hardware should you buy. We've been working to come up with an IoT Cart - a suggested set of hardware that you can buy and use to pack out a cart that can be used by students to cover most IoT scenarios.

The labs included in the [labs](../labs) folder are based on the hardware that we suggest for such a cart.

This is very much a version 1 of a continuously evolving and growing cart specification.

We have supplied some IoT carts to a few academic institutions. If you have received a cart, the contents is listed in the [cart Manifest](./Manifest.md).

The cart hardware consists of:
